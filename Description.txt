This simple program shows the use of GUI package called Tkinter and use of OS processes.

I have made a simple GUI with four buttons. (Restart, Restart with Time, Logout, Shutdown)

Tkinter docs are available online and are really simple to use. 
There is a slight use of OS processes which can be easily understood.
